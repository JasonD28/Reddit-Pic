Reddit Pic is a Google Chrome Extension that uses various API to replace the default new tab and display a new aesthetic one. The tab features the date and the time on the left, a high quality picture in the center, and the temperature on the right. The date and time is taken from the javascript Date() object. The picture is taken from the top post of the day from the Reddit.com subreddit r/itookapicture. The weather information is taken from the weather API Dark Sky. The background colors are taken from the Imagga API after the picture is sent to it.
